Q1.

local function releaseStorage(player)
    -- Sets the storage value to -1, indicating storage is being released.
    -- Check if the player object is valid to prevent potential errors
    if player then
        player:setStorageValue(1000, -1)
    end
end

function onLogout(player)
    -- If the storage value is 1, schedule the release of storage with a delay of 1000ms
    if player:getStorageValue(1000) == 1 then
        addEvent(releaseStorage, 1000, player)
    end
    return true
end

- Added comments to clarify why `setStorageValue` is set to -1.
- The original code is logically sound, it sets a delayed action to release storage only if a certain condition is met.
- Added player object validation

Q2.

function printSmallGuildNames(memberCount)
    -- This method is supposed to print names of all guilds that have less than memberCount max members
    local selectGuildQuery = "SELECT name FROM guilds WHERE max_members < %d;"
    -- Define the SQL query template for selecting guild names with fewer than `memberCount` max members
    local queryString = string.format(selectGuildQuery, memberCount)
    -- Format the query string with the provided memberCount
    local resultId = db.storeQuery(queryString)
    -- Execute the query and store the result in resultId

    if resultId ~= nil then
        -- Check if the query returned any results
        repeat
            local guildName = result.getString(resultId, "name")
            -- Get the guild name from the current row in the result set
            print(guildName)
            -- Print the guild name
        until not result.next(resultId)
        -- Move to the next row in the result set; continue until there are no more rows
        result.free(resultId)
        -- Free the result storage to avoid memory leaks
    else
        print("No guilds found with less than " .. memberCount .. " members.")
        -- Print a message if no guilds were found with fewer than memberCount members
    end
end

- Added a loop to handle multiple results since the query might return multiple rows.
- Included a check to ensure the result is valid.
- Frees the allocated memory to avoid a memory leak.
- Added error handling
- Improved comments

Q3.

function removePartyMemberByName(playerId, memberName)
    local player = Player(playerId)
    local party = player:getParty()

    if not party then
        -- If the player does not have a party, exit the function
        return
    end

    local memberToRemove = nil
    for _, member in pairs(party:getMembers()) do
        if member:getName() == memberName then
            -- If the member name matches, store the member in memberToRemove
            memberToRemove = member
            break
        end
    end

    if memberToRemove then
        -- If a matching member is found, remove them from the party
        party:removeMember(memberToRemove)
    end
end

- Renamed the function to `removePartyMemberByName` for clarity.
- Checked if the player has a party before trying to access it.
- Used a more efficient loop to find and remove the member by name. 
- Optimized by breaking the loop once the member is found.
- Improved comments

Q4.

void Game::addItemToPlayer(const std::string& recipient, uint16_t itemId) {
    // Attempt to get the player by name
    Player* player = g_game.getPlayerByName(recipient);
    bool createdPlayer = false;

    if (!player) {
        // If player does not exist, create a new one and load player data
        player = new Player(nullptr);
        if (!IOLoginData::loadPlayerByName(player, recipient)) {
            delete player;  // Cleanup to prevent memory leak
            return;
        }
        createdPlayer = true;
    }

    // Create the item and check if creation was successful
    Item* item = Item::CreateItem(itemId);
    if (!item) {
        // Cleanup the player if we created it in this method
        if (createdPlayer) {
            delete player;
        }
        return;
    }

    // Attempt to add the item to the player's inbox
    g_game.internalAddItem(player->getInbox(), item, INDEX_WHEREEVER, FLAG_NOLIMIT);

    // If the player is offline, save the player's state
    if (player->isOffline()) {
        IOLoginData::savePlayer(player);
    }

    // If the player was created by this method, clean up allocated memory
    if (createdPlayer) {
        delete player;
    }
}

// - Added comments for each segment
// - Attempt to get a player by their name.
// - If the player does not exist, create a new player instance and attempt to load the player data; handle cleanup if loading fails.
// - Attempt to create the item; if creation fails, handle player cleanup to prevent memory leaks.
// - If item creation is successful, add the item to the player's inbox.
// - If the player is offline, ensure their state is saved to prevent data loss.
// - If the player was created within this method, clean up the allocated memory to prevent memory leaks.
